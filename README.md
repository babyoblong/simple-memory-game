## UX

#### First Time Visitor Goals
* As a first-time visitor, I want to understand the purpose of the game/site.
* As a first-time visitor, I want to understand how to navigate the game/site.

#### Returning Visitor Goals
* As a returning visitor, I want to be able to jump into a game.

## Deviations   

1. Originally I had intended to base the Simple Memory Game on World of Warcraft. The game has it's own mini-game where you have to match the symbols. Not wanting to infringe on copyright I decided to stick with Simple Memory Game instead.
